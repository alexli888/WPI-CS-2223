FOR LUCAS NUMBERS
- These ratio of successive calculations seem to be related to the golden ratio (where a ratio between two numbers that equals about 1.618),
where the ratio between two consecutive numbers converges to the golden ratio as we progress in the sequence of lucas numbers.
The successive calculation times shows that as we calculate larger Lucas Numbers, the time it takes to compute them decreases. This highlights
the algorithms efficiency.

- The order of growth of this algorithm is O(n), as we use memorization of the previously computed lucas numbers by
storing them in an array. Also, our linear recursive structure calls in the algorithm means that the number of recursive
calls grown linearilly with n.  As we increase n, the time to complete grows linearly.


FOR MY 'CUSTOM SEQUENCE' (The Sequence of Prime Numbers)
- The ratios of successive prime numbers appears to get closer to 1 as we increase n .

- I believe the order of growth for this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), as in the for loop of the algorithm, we check teh conditions
in the for loop a maximum of (sqrt(n))/6 times, while the rest of the operations in the algorithm are O(1). Therefore,
the overall order of growth for this algorithm should be O(sqrt(n)).
